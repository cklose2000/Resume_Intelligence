# Enhanced Editor Test Suite Roadmap

## Current State
- ✅ 272 comprehensive tests written across 9 test files
- ✅ Complete unit and integration test coverage
- ⚠️ Execution timeouts in WSL2 environment
- ⚠️ Tests need optimization for CI/CD environments

## Phase 1: Test Execution Stability (Week 1-2)
### 1.1 Diagnose Timeout Issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**
  - Profile test execution to identify bottlenecks
  - Analyze heavy DOM operations and TipTap initialization
  - Check for memory leaks in test environment
  
- **Immediate Fixes**
  - Increase test timeouts selectively for complex tests
  - Implement test chunking to run suites in parallel
  - Optimize mock implementations to reduce overhead
  - Add cleanup hooks to prevent memory accumulation

### 1.2 Environment Optimization
- Configure Vitest for optimal WSL2 performance
- Set up proper Node.js memory limits
- Implement test caching strategies
- Create lightweight mock alternatives for heavy dependencies

## Phase 2: CI/CD Integration (Week 2-3)
### 2.1 GitHub Actions Setup
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:ci
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### 2.2 Test Reporting
- Integrate test results with GitHub PR checks
- Set up coverage reporting with Codecov/Coveralls
- Create test performance dashboards
- Implement failure notifications

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization (Week 3-4)
### 3.1 Test Suite Optimization
- **Parallel Execution**
  - Split tests into isolated workers
  - Implement shared test fixtures
  - Use test.concurrent for independent tests
  
- **Mock Optimization**
  - Create lightweight TipTap mock
  - Implement lazy-loaded mocks
  - Cache expensive setup operations

### 3.2 Performance Benchmarks
- Set performance budgets for test execution
- Monitor test duration trends
- Implement automatic performance regression detection

## Phase 4: Enhanced Testing Capabilities (Week 4-6)
### 4.1 Visual Regression Testing
- **Playwright Integration**
  ```typescript
  // visual-regression.spec.ts
  test('Resume preview renders correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/editor');
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('resume-preview.png');
  });
  ```
- Set up visual diff reporting
- Create baseline screenshots for all UI states

### 4.2 End-to-End Testing
- **Critical User Flows**
  1. Complete resume creation workflow
  2. AI optimization flow
  3. Multi-format export process
  4. Real-time collaboration scenarios
  
- **Implementation Strategy**
  - Use Playwright for browser automation
  - Test against production-like environment
  - Include accessibility checks in E2E tests

## Phase 5: Advanced Testing Features (Week 6-8)
### 5.1 Mutation Testing
- Integrate Stryker for mutation testing
- Ensure test quality and coverage effectiveness
- Identify weak test cases

### 5.2 Contract Testing
- Define API contracts for AI services
- Implement consumer-driven contract tests
- Ensure backend compatibility

### 5.3 Load Testing
- Test editor performance with large documents
- Simulate concurrent user sessions
- Benchmark AI suggestion response times

## Implementation Priority Matrix

| Priority | Task | Impact | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| P0 | Fix test timeouts | Critical | Medium |
| P0 | Set up CI/CD | Critical | Low |
| P1 | Performance optimization | High | Medium |
| P1 | Visual regression tests | High | Medium |
| P2 | E2E test suite | High | High |
| P2 | Coverage reporting | Medium | Low |
| P3 | Mutation testing | Medium | High |
| P3 | Load testing | Medium | Medium |

## Success Metrics
- **Execution Time**: < 5 minutes for full suite
- **Coverage**: Maintain > 90% code coverage
- **Reliability**: 100% pass rate in CI environment
- **Performance**: No test takes > 5 seconds
- **Feedback**: Test results available within 2 minutes of push

## Tooling Recommendations
1. **Test Runner**: Continue with Vitest (optimize configuration)
2. **E2E Testing**: Playwright (modern, fast, reliable)
3. **Visual Testing**: Percy or Chromatic
4. **Coverage**: Codecov with GitHub integration
5. **Performance**: Lighthouse CI for performance budgets

## Next Steps
1. Create test:ci script optimized for CI environment
2. Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow
3. Profile current test execution bottlenecks
4. Implement first round of optimizations
5. Begin E2E test implementation for critical flows
